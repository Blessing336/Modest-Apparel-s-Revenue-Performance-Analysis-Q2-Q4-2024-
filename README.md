<h3 align="center">Orders Peaked at 805 in June Before Dropping 42% to 469 by Year End</h3>
  
<p align="center">

</p>

<br/>

<h3 align="center">THE STRONG START (May-June 2024)</h3>

The business started well, **generating ₦509.5M in revenue from 1,580 orders over two months**. June represented **peak performance with 805 orders**, demonstrating robust customer acquisition and healthy engagement levels. Customer purchasing patterns remained stable and predictable, with Average Order Value (AOV) **holding steady at ₦320-327K throughout this period**.

<br/>

<br/>

<h3 align="center">THE DECLINE (July-December 2024)</h3>

Initial decline signals appeared in July when orders **decreased 6.8% to 750 units**. By August, order volume had fallen further to **720**. September revenue **reached ₦288.1M**, creating an appearance of recovery. However, this masked critical underlying issues:

<br/>

- Order volume continued **declining to 665 (from June's 805)**
- The revenue increase came from elevated AOV **(₦433K)**, not increased orders (this means fewer customers were making larger purchases)

<br/>

<br/>

<h3 align="center">THE CRISIS PERIOD (September-November)</h3>

The final quarter revealed the severity of business challenges:

In October, revenue declined **30% month-over-month to ₦201.6M** as economic crisis conditions intensified. In November, performance remained low **at ₦198.4M with 496 orders** (the lowest monthly order count) and in December, despite traditional holiday season strength, revenue fell to **₦187.5M with only 469 orders**.

</p>


**1. Primary Issue: Order Volume Collapse**

<br/>

Order count declined **27.5% quarter-over-quarter from Q3 to Q4 (2,135 orders to 1,547 orders)**. This represents the dominant driver of revenue decline. While AOV increased **9.8%** to partially offset losses, the reduction in customer transactions proved overwhelming. The loss of **588 quarterly orders** equates to approximately **₦200M** in foregone revenue.

<br/>

**2. Operational Issue: Delivery Performance Failure**

Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance rates reveal critical logistics problems:

<br/>

- Lagos region: **18-24%** on-time delivery (below acceptable standards)
- Ogun/Oyo regions: **0%** on-time delivery (complete failure)
- Other locations: **0%** on-time delivery (complete failure)

<br/>

**3. Portfolio Issue: Inefficient Product Mix and Dead Stock**

The business maintains **90 SKUs, with 47 products (52% of portfolio) generating only 5.2%** of revenue. One product (Black Sleeveless Jumpsuit) has **47 units in dead stock with 6% sell-through rate**. This inefficiency ties up capital, increases complexity, and dilutes management focus from high-performing products.

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<h3 align="center">RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>

* Conduct emergency performance reviews with all carrier partners and begin evaluation of alternative carrier options for regional markets if they are unwilling to make changes.
* Implement flash sale for Black Sleeveless Jumpsuit to recover approximately ₦700K in tied-up capital
* Launch tiered discount program: 10% after 5th purchase, 15% after 10th purchase
* Create bundle offers: Traditional + Modern products with 20% discount
